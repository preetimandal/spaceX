# spaceX Program launch
========================
I have use Angular 9 for doing this.
There are 2 component: 1. space-xdata.component, 2. filter.component

Transfering data (JSON response) from filter.component to space-xdata.component, I am using sibling service (Sibling Component Interaction)
=> first-time page load without any Filters:
    https://api.spaceXdata.com/v3/launches?limit=100
